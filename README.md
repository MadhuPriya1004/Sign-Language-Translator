**Sign Language Translator**

**Overview**

Welcome to the Sign Language Translator project! This cutting-edge tool uses computer vision and machine learning to transcribe sign language gestures into text. It enhances accessibility and facilitates communication for the non-hearing community by providing real-time translation of sign language, bridging communication gaps and fostering inclusivity.

**Project Structure**

- **Sign Language Transcription.ipynb:** Contains code for detecting, classifying, and translating hand gestures into text, including preprocessing, model training, and live transcription.
- **data (Optional):** Directory for storing the dataset used for model training.
- **models (Optional):** Directory for saving and loading trained machine learning models.

**Setup and Installation**

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sign-language-transcription.git
   cd sign-language-transcription
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   Ensure Python is installed and then install required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Download or Prepare the Dataset:**
   - Place the dataset in the `data` directory if provided.
   - Alternatively, prepare your dataset by following instructions in the notebook.

4. **Run the Jupyter Notebook:**
   Start Jupyter Notebook from your terminal:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
   Open the `Sign Language Transcription.ipynb` notebook to begin.

**Usage**

1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   Follow the notebook to preprocess gesture images, including resizing, normalization, and augmentation.

2. **Model Training:**
   Train the model using the dataset, covering model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation.

3. **Transcription:**
   Use the trained model to transcribe new sign language gestures into text. The notebook includes code for real-time transcription.

4. **Evaluation:**
   Assess the modelâ€™s performance on a test set to ensure accuracy and reliability.
