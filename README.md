# Sign Language Translator
Overview

Welcome to the Sign Language Translator project! This cutting-edge tool leverages the power of computer vision and machine learning to seamlessly transcribe sign language gestures into text. Designed to enhance accessibility and facilitate communication for the non-hearing community, this project provides real-time translation of sign language, bridging communication gaps and fostering inclusivity.

Project Structure

- Sign Language Transcription.ipynb: The heart of the project, this Jupyter Notebook contains comprehensive code for detecting, classifying, and translating hand gestures into text. It includes sections on preprocessing, model training, and live transcription.
- data(Optional): Directory to store the dataset used for model training.
- models(Optional): Directory for saving and loading trained machine learning models.

Setup and Installation

1. Clone the Repository:
   bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sign-language-transcription.git
   cd sign-language-transcription
   

2. Install Dependencies:
   Ensure you have Python installed. Then, install the required packages:
   bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   

3. Download or Prepare the Dataset:
   - If a dataset is provided, place it in the data directory.
   - Alternatively, prepare your dataset for training by following the instructions in the notebook.

4. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
   Start Jupyter Notebook from your terminal:
   bash
   jupyter notebook
   
   Open the `Sign Language Transcription.ipynb` notebook to get started.

 Usage

1. Data Preprocessing:
   The notebook guides you through preprocessing gesture images, including resizing, normalization, and augmentation to ensure high-quality inputs for the model.

2. Model Training:
   Train your model using the provided dataset. The notebook covers various aspects such as model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation to ensure optimal performance.

3. Transcription:
   Utilize the trained model to transcribe new sign language gestures into text. The notebook includes code for loading the model and performing real-time transcription.

4. Evaluation:
   Assess the model’s performance on a test set to validate its accuracy and reliability.
